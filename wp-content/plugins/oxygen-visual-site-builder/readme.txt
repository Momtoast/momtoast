= Design Everything =

Oxygen isn't just a page builder. It's a complete site builder that entirely replaces your theme.

Create headers, footers, content, and everything else all from Oxygen's extremely powerful visual editor.

= Dynamic Content & Plugins =

Apply your designs to blog posts, custom post types, archives, plugin pages, or anything else.

Write PHP code directly inside Oxygen. Call WordPress API functions, run the WordPress loop and custom WP queries, and get a live preview of the output.

= Very Advanced =

[Search "wp oxygen review" on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=wp+oxygen+review) to see some video reviews of Oxygen and get a better idea of whether Oxygen is right for you.

The only thing that rivals Oxygen's power is hand-coding your theme from scratch. Oxygen is certainly easier than hand-coding, and we're working on making Oxygen easier to use, but if you're a beginner, Oxygen probably won't be as easy to use as a typical page builder would be.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Is Oxygen compatible with page builders?**
Yes. In addition to using Oxygen to design your entire site, you can use Oxygen in conjunction with popular page builders like Elementor or Beaver Builder. Design your site's headers, footers, and other templates with Oxygen, and design your inner page content using the page builder.

**Can I edit an existing theme with Oxygen?**
No. Oxygen is a visual replacement for your theme. Your theme no longer has any control over the design of your site. It is all controlled by Oxygen. To edit an existing theme, we recommend using a plugin like Microthemer, Yellow Pencil, or CSS Hero.
